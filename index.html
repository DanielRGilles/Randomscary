      <article> DIABLO LORD OF WAFFLES<p class="break"><br></p>  the Fallen Angle, eh?

        You'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel like some great evil is permeating the air around here.

        Drognan told me about Hratli when we were in Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves magic into his forge and
        produces
        mystical weapons and armor.

        His skills could be quite useful to you.Long ago, the Soulstones were given to the Horadrim by the Archangel
        Tyrael.
        They were used to bind the three Prime Evils. I now know that even these holy artifacts were no match for
        Diablo's
        power.

        I hope that his two brothers are more securely held... but I fear the worst.It is certain that we face the demon
        queen, Andariel, who has corrupted the Rogue Sisterhood and defiled their ancestral Monastery. This does not
        bode
        well for us, my friend.

        Ancient Horadric texts record that Andariel and the other Lesser Evils once overthrew the three Prime Evils --
        Diablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing them from Hell to our world. Here, they caused mankind untold anguish and
        suffering before they were finally bound within the Soulstones.

        Andariel's presence here could mean that the forces of Hell are once again aligned behind Diablo and his
        Brothers.
        If this is true, then I fear for us all. You must kill her before the Monastery becomes a permanent outpost of
        Hell
        and the way east lost forever.The appearance of the mage you describe sounds like one I met back in Tristram.
        Many
        Vizjerei came to fight against Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Perhaps, this is one of them.

        You know, fate seems to have frowned upon all of the heroes who confronted that terrible Evil. Take care or the
        same
        may happen to you.During my time with the Horadrim, we often debated the nature of Mount Arreat.

        We knew that the Barbarian clans zealously guarded the mountain as their sacred duty. However, many dismissed
        their
        zeal as simple superstition...combined with an inborn hostility toward outsiders.

        Those Horadrim who trekked up Arreat were never heard from again...Still, I do not believe they died at the
        hands
        of
        the Barbarians.

        Regrettably, I could do nothing to prevent the disaster which devastated Tristram. It would appear that our
        greatest
        fears have come to pass. Diablo, the Lord of Terror, has once again been set loose upon the world!

        As you know, some time ago Diablo was slain beneath Tristram. And when our hero emerged triumphant from the
        labyrinth beneath town, we held a grand celebration that lasted several days.

        Yet, as the weeks passed, our hero became increasingly aloof. He kept his distance from the rest of the
        townsfolk
        and seemed to lapse into a dark, brooding depression. I thought that perhaps his ordeal had been so disturbing
        that
        he simply could not put it out of his mind.

        The hero seemed more tormented every passing day. I remember he awoke many times -- screaming in the night --
        always
        something about 'the East'.

        One day, he simply left. And shortly thereafter Tristram was attacked by legions of foul demons. Many were
        slain,
        and the demons left me to die in that cursed cage.

        I believe now that Tristram's hero was that Dark Wanderer who passed this way before the Monastery fell.

        I fear even worse, my friend... I fear that Diablo has taken possession of the hero who sought to slay him. If
        true,
        Diablo will become more powerful than ever before.

        You must stop him or all will be lost.You have quite a treasure there in that Horadric Cube. According to
        Horadric
        lore, the Cube can restore a Horadric Staff.

        To do it - use the Cube as you would a scroll. When the Cube opens, place both pieces of the Staff into it and
        use
        the Cube's transmute power.

        You'll be pleased to know that the Cube has other alchemical uses as well...

      <p>
        The Horadrim used to mummify their highest mages, and infuse them with spells that would allow them to protect
        their tombs, even after death.

        I have no idea why one of them would be acting so malevolently. Perhaps Drognan or Fara would know more about
        this.Ohh...This is a truly horrible turn of events.

        I know it seems you have always been one step behind, my friend. But look at it this way...You have evil on the
        run.
